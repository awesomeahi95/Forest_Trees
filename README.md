Analysis

The analysis is based on the data published by US Forest Service (USFS). Each observation contains information of type of tree coverage of a (30 x 30 meter cell) at four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each cell contains a number of features including information about the soil type, elevation, and sunlight conditions, and there are a total of 7 possible types of trees.

These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances,so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The porpuse of our analysis is to determine a model based on those cartographical features and provide our costumer with a tool to identify possible ideal areas to grow Lodgepole Pine with the least human intervention. Our costumer would like to explore areas outside this particular forest , therefore we would remove from the dataset the relevant columns regarding specific areas of this forest and check if we obtain a good prediction model.

The steps to follow are :

1. Data understanding
2. Data visualization
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
  - Baseline Model via Logistic Regression
  - Decition tree
  - Random Forest
  - Ensemble methods
  - Adaboost
  - Stackking
5. Model selection
6. Threshold Selection
7. Final Evaluation
